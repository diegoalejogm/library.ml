Implementation of Probabilistic Machine Learning models learned through the reading of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Book.

Handwritten solutions to the book exercises, done by myself, may be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mb25knsxraz2j4k/AAB531Meqem09mncNW6TGKkQa?dl=0)

## Index

#### Regression
- [x] **Least Squares (Max. Likelihood) Linear Regression**
  - [x] Gradient descent
  - [x] Closed form
- [ ] **Bayesian Linear Regression**

#### Clasification
- **Discriminant Functions**
  - [ ] Least Squares
  - [ ] Fisher's Linear Discriminant
  - [ ] Perceptron algorithm
- **Probabilistic Generative Models**
  - [ ] Maximum Likelihood
- **Probabilistic Discriminative Models**
  - [ ] Logistic Regression (Iterative reweighted least sq.)

Note: _All algorithms must work for binary classification and continuous features. Algorithms that may work with multi-class classification or discrete-feature classification, must allow multi-class classification or discrete-feature classification, respectively._
